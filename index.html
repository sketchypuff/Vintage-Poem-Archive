            <p>If you want a thing bad enough</p>
            <p>To go out and fight for it,</p>
            <p>Give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it;</p>
            <p>If only desire of it</p>
            <p>Makes your aim strong enough</p>
            <p>
              Never to tire of it, If life seems all empty and useless without
              it
            </p>
            <p>And all that you scheme and you dream is about it,</p>
            <p>If gladly you’ll sweat for it,</p>
            <p>Fret for it,</p>
            <p>Plan for it,</p>
            <p>Pray with all your strength for it,</p>
            <p>If you’ll only go after the thing that you want,</p>
            <p>With all your capacity,</p>
            <p>Strength and sagacity,</p>
            <p>Faith, hope, and confidence; stern pertinacity,</p>
            <p>If neither cold or poverty, famished and gaunt,</p>
            <p>Nor sickness, nor pain,</p>
            <p>Of body or brain,</p>
            <p>Can turn you away from the aim that you want,</p>
            <p>If dogged and grim you besiege and beset it,</p>
            <p>You’ll get it!</p>
